# Student Gradebook
This Python project allows users to manage student data efficiently. Users can enter each student’s first and last name, along with their grades in various subjects. The program then processes this data to:

1. Validate the entered information.
2. Calculate the average grade for each student.
3. Determine the rank of each student based on their average grade.
4. Assign a grade of success.
5. Evaluate the student’s status as pass or fail.

This project aims to streamline the process of student evaluation, making it easier for educators to track and analyze student performance.

## Features:


1. User-Friendly Data Entry:
    * Allows users to input student names, surnames, and grades in various subjects.

2. Data Validation:
    * Ensures that all entered data is accurate and complete before processing.

3. Average Grade Calculation:
    * Automatically calculates the average grade for each student based on their subject grades.

4. Student Ranking:
    * Ranks students according to their average grades, providing a clear view of their performance relative to peers.

5. Grade of Success Assignment:
    * Assigns a grade of success (e.g., A, B, C) based on predefined criteria.

6. Pass/Fail Status Evaluation:
    * Determines whether a student has passed or failed based on their average grade and other criteria.

7. Comprehensive Reporting:
    * Generates detailed reports summarizing each student’s performance, including their average grade, rank, grade of success, and pass/fail status.

8. Scalability:
    * Can handle a large number of students and subjects, making it suitable for various educational settings.

## Testing:

In order to test my code, I used python tutor, it is a fantastic tool for visualizing and debugging a Python code. It allows me to see the execution of my code step-by-step, which can be incredibly helpful for understanding how my code works and for finding bugs.

## Deployement:

Deploying a Python app to Heroku involves using the Heroku platform to host and manage my application. Heroku provides a cloud environment where I can easily push my code, and it handles the deployment, scaling, and management of my app. By using Heroku, I can focus on developing my application without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. This makes it an excellent choice for quickly getting my first Python app up and running on the web.
